- Proper drainage

### Joint Sand Replacement (Pavers)

**When needed:**
- Sand level below paver surface
- Weed growth in joints
- Paver movement
- After pressure washing

**Process:**
1. Remove old sand
2. Clean joints thoroughly
3. Add polymeric sand
4. Compact and activate

### UV Protection Treatments

**For concrete:**
- Apply UV-resistant sealer
- Consider tinted sealers
- Repair surface damage

**For asphalt:**
- Sealcoat application
- Crack sealing
- Edge maintenance

## Fall Driveway Maintenance (September-November)

### Pre-Winter Sealing

**Critical timing:**
- 30-60 days before first frost
- Allows proper curing
- Protects before winter
- Easier application weather

**Priority:**
- Most important sealing of year
- Prevents winter damage
- Seals cracks before freeze-thaw

### Leaf and Debris Removal

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents staining
- Reduces slip hazards
- Allows surface drying
- Prevents organic growth

**Frequency:**
- Weekly during peak fall
- Don't allow accumulation
- Remove before rain

### Final Crack Repairs Before Freeze

**Urgent repairs:**
- All cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- Potholes
- Spalled areas
- Joint damage

**Materials:**
- Use flexible fillers
- Follow temperature guidelines
- Allow cure time

### Drainage Path Clearance

**Prepare for snowmelt:**
- Clear all drainage channels
- Remove sediment from catch basins
- Verify slope is maintained
- Clear gutters and downspouts

## Winter Driveway Maintenance (December-February)

### Safe Snow and Ice Removal

**Tools by material:**
- Concrete: Plastic shovels
- Asphalt: Plastic or rubber-edged
- Pavers: Plastic, rounded edges

**Technique:**
- Remove promptly
- Don't scrape surface
- Avoid sharp impacts
- Clear to edges

### De-Icer Application Guidelines

**Safe products:**
- Calcium chloride
- Magnesium chloride
- Potassium chloride
- CMA (safest)

**Application:**
- Use minimum effective amount
- Apply before snowfall when possible
- Avoid rock salt on concrete
- Clear slush promptly

### Monitoring for New Damage

**Watch for:**
- New cracks
- Expanding existing cracks
- Pothole formation
- Drainage problems
- Ice damming

**Document:**
- Photos for spring repair planning
