**Cost:** $12-25 per square foot

**Best for:** High-end homes, hurricane zones

### Shell and Crushed Limestone

**Regional tradition:**
- Naturally salt-resistant
- Excellent drainage
- Local availability
- Coastal aesthetic

**Considerations:**
- Limited to certain regions
- Requires periodic replenishment
- Can be sharp
- Not for all styles

**Cost:** $2-5 per square foot

**Best for:** Coastal areas, traditional Florida homes

### Permeable Options for Flood Zones

**Benefits in Florida:**
- Reduces runoff
- Recharges groundwater
- May meet flood requirements
- Handles heavy rain

**Options:**
- Permeable pavers
- Porous asphalt
- Gravel with grid

**Cost:** $12-25 per square foot

**Best for:** Flood-prone areas, environmental compliance

## Florida Driveway Permits and Codes

- Material specifications
- Thickness standards

**Process:**
1. Submit application
2. Pay fees ($100-500)
3. Schedule inspections
4. Receive approval

### HOA Restrictions

**Common HOA rules:**
- Approved materials list
- Color restrictions
- Design standards
- Maintenance requirements

**Before installing:**
- Review HOA documents
- Submit for approval
- Obtain written permission
- Follow guidelines

### Impervious Surface Limits

**Environmental regulations:**
- Limit on total impervious area
- Stormwater management required
- May require permeable surfaces
- Credits for green design

**Compliance options:**
- Permeable driveway materials
- Rain gardens
- Retention systems
- Offset credits

### Stormwater Management Requirements

**Florida's strict regulations:**
- On-site stormwater treatment
- Runoff volume control
- Water quality standards
- Erosion prevention

**Solutions:**
- Permeable surfaces
- Retention/detention systems
- Swales and rain gardens
- Professional engineering

## Hurricane-Proofing Your Driveway

### Flood-Resistant Design

**Design strategies:**
- Elevated driveway sections
- Permeable materials
- Enhanced drainage
- Quick recovery features

**Materials:**
- Pavers (easy to reset)
- Concrete (durable)
- Avoid: Materials that wash out

### Wind-Debris Considerations

**Impact resistance:**
- Concrete performs well
- Pavers resist damage
- Quality installation essential
- Avoid loose materials

**Protection:**
- Secure edge restraints
- Quality base preparation
- Proper thickness
- Professional installation

### Post-Storm Inspection and Repair

**After hurricane:**
- Inspect for damage
- Document for insurance
- Address drainage issues
- Repair promptly

**Common repairs:**
- Reset displaced pavers
- Fill erosion areas
- Repair cracks
- Restore drainage

## Regional Considerations

### South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach)
