# Driveway Resurfacing vs Replacement: How to Decide

When your driveway shows signs of age and wear, you're faced with a critical decision: resurface or replace? This choice significantly impacts both your immediate budget and long-term satisfaction. Understanding the differences between resurfacing and replacement, along with knowing when each option is appropriate, helps you make the best decision for your situation.

## What Is Driveway Resurfacing?

### The Resurfacing Process

Resurfacing adds a new layer over your existing driveway:

**For asphalt:**
1. Clean and repair existing surface
2. Apply tack coat for adhesion
3. Add 1.5-2 inches of new asphalt
4. Compact and finish

**For concrete:**
1. Clean and prepare surface
2. Repair major cracks
3. Apply overlay material (1-2 inches)
4. Finish and cure

**Timeline:** 1-3 days vs. 3-7 days for replacement

### Best Candidates for Resurfacing

**Ideal conditions for resurfacing:**
- Surface cracks only (no structural damage)
- Base is stable and well-drained
- Driveway is less than 20 years old
- Less than 25% of surface needs repair
- No significant settlement or heaving

**Asphalt indicators:**
- Faded but not crumbling
- Minor cracking (less than 1/4 inch wide)
- No potholes or base failure
- Edges intact

**Concrete indicators:**
- Surface scaling but sound structure
- Minor cracking without displacement
- No settlement or sinking
- Joints functioning properly

### Expected Lifespan After Resurfacing

**Asphalt overlay:**
- 10-15 years with proper maintenance
- 50-75% of new asphalt lifespan
- Requires sealing every 1-3 years

**Concrete overlay:**
- 10-15 years
- Less than new concrete (25-30 years)
- May develop reflective cracking

## What Is Driveway Replacement?

### The Full Replacement Process

Complete removal and new installation:

1. **Remove existing driveway:** Break up and haul away
2. **Excavate base:** Remove and assess base material
3. **Prepare subgrade:** Compact soil, address drainage
4. **Install new base:** Add and compact aggregate
5. **Place new surface:** Pour concrete or lay asphalt
6. **Finish and cure:** Complete installation properly

**Timeline:** 3-7 days depending on material and size

### When Replacement Is the Only Option

**Structural damage requires replacement:**
- Base failure (sinking, heaving, potholes)
- Extensive cracking with displacement
- Age exceeding expected lifespan
- Drainage problems causing damage
- More than 25% of surface damaged

**Asphalt replacement indicators:**
- Alligator cracking (interconnected pattern)
- Multiple deep potholes
- Edge deterioration
- Age over 20 years

**Concrete replacement indicators:**
- Major settlement or heaving
- Structural cracks with lifting
- Spalling affecting more than 25% of surface
- Age over 25-30 years

### Expected Lifespan After Replacement

**New asphalt:**
- 15-20 years with maintenance
- Full expected lifespan
- Proper base ensures longevity

**New concrete:**
- 25-30 years
- Full expected lifespan
- Opportunity to correct base issues

## Cost Comparison

### Resurfacing Costs by Material

| Material | Cost per Sq Ft | 600 Sq Ft Driveway |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Asphalt overlay | $2-4 | $1,200-2,400 |
| Concrete overlay | $5-10 | $3,000-6,000 |
| Paver reset | $4-8 | $2,400-4,800 |

### Replacement Costs by Material

| Material | Cost per Sq Ft | 600 Sq Ft Driveway |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Asphalt (new) | $3-7 | $1,800-4,200 |
| Concrete (new) | $4-15 | $2,400-9,000 |
| Pavers (new) | $10-30 | $6,000-18,000 |

### Long-term Value Analysis

**20-year cost comparison (600 sq ft driveway):**

| Option | Initial Cost | Maintenance | Total 20-Year |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Asphalt overlay | $1,800 | $3,000 | $4,800 |
| Asphalt replacement | $3,000 | $2,500 | $5,500 |
| Concrete overlay | $4,500 | $1,500 | $6,000 |
| Concrete replacement | $5,400 | $1,000 | $6,400 |

## How to Assess Your Driveway's Condition

### Surface Cracks vs Structural Damage

**Surface cracks (can resurface):**
- Hairline to 1/4 inch wide
- No vertical displacement
- No base material visible
- Less than 25% of surface

**Structural damage (needs replacement):**
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- Vertical displacement (one side higher)
- Base material exposed
- Alligator cracking pattern

### Base Failure Indicators

**Signs of base problems:**
- Sinking or depression areas
- Heaving or upheaval
- Water pooling in specific spots
- Potholes that return after repair
- Edge breakup

**Test:** Push a screwdriver into cracks. If it sinks easily into base material, base failure is likely.

### Age-Based Decision Framework

| Age | Asphalt | Concrete | Recommendation |
|-----|---------|----------|----------------|
| 0-10 years | Repair | Repair | Minor repairs |
| 10-15 years | Overlay | Repair | Consider overlay |
| 15-20 years | Replace | Overlay | Replace asphalt |
| 20-25 years | Replace | Overlay/Replace | Evaluate concrete |
| 25+ years | Replace | Replace | Replace either |

## Resurfacing and Replacement by Material

### Concrete Options

**Resurfacing:**
- Thin overlay (1-2 inches)
- Microtopping (1/8-1/4 inch)
- Stamped overlay for decorative finish

**Replacement:**
- Remove and replace
- Opportunity to add thickness
- Correct base problems

### Asphalt Options

**Resurfacing:**
- Overlay (1.5-2 inches)
- Must have sound base
- Less expensive than replacement

**Replacement:**
- Full removal and replacement
- Address base issues
- Longer lasting solution

### Paver Options

**Resurfacing:**
- Lift and relay existing pavers
- Add new base material
- Reset with proper bedding

**Replacement:**

- Updated design options

## Questions to Ask Your Contractor

Before deciding, get professional assessments:

1. **What is the condition of my base?**
2. **Can you guarantee an overlay will last?**
3. **What caused the current damage?**
4. **Will problems recur with overlay?**
5. **What is the cost difference long-term?**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it cheaper to resurface or replace a driveway?

**Resurfacing is cheaper upfront** (50-75% of replacement cost). However, replacement often provides better long-term value if your driveway has structural issues or is near the end of its lifespan.

### How long does resurfacing last?

**Asphalt overlay:** 10-15 years
**Concrete overlay:** 10-15 years
**Paver reset:** 15-20 years

Resurfacing typically provides 50-75% of a new driveway's lifespan.

### Can you resurface a cracked driveway?

**Surface cracks (under 1/4 inch):** Yes, can be filled and overlaid
**Structural cracks:** No, indicates base problems requiring replacement
**Alligator cracking:** No, requires replacement

### When is replacement the better investment?

Replace when:
- Base has failed
- Age exceeds 75% of expected lifespan
- Damage affects more than 25% of surface
- Drainage problems exist
- You plan to stay in home long-term
