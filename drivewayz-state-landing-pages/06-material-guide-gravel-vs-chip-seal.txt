WHAT IS GRAVEL?

drainage.

GRAVEL CONS:

- Difficult snow removal
- Can develop ruts and potholes
- Dust in dry conditions
- Not ideal for steep slopes
- Weeds grow through

WHAT IS CHIP SEAL?
Chip seal (also called tar and chip) involves spraying liquid asphalt onto a 
prepared base, then covering it with aggregate stones and rolling. It creates 
a paved surface with a textured, natural stone appearance.
