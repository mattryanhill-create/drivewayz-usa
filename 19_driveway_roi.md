# Driveway ROI: How Much Does a New Driveway Add to Home Value?

A new driveway is one of the most visible home improvements you can make. But does this investment translate into increased property value? Understanding driveway return on investment (ROI) helps homeowners make informed decisions about when to replace their driveway and which materials offer the best financial returns.

## The Curb Appeal Factor

### First Impressions and Buyer Psychology

Your driveway creates the first impression visitors and potential buyers have of your home:

- **Visible from street:** One of the largest visible surfaces
- **Daily use:** Every arrival and departure
- **Condition signals:** Cracked driveway suggests deferred maintenance
- **Aesthetic impact:** Complements or detracts from home appearance

Studies show that curb appeal can influence a buyer's perception of home value by 5-10% before they even enter the house.

### Real Estate Agent Perspectives

**National Association of Realtors (NAR) data:**

- Curb appeal projects: Top priority for sellers

**Agent recommendations:**
- Replace if cracked or stained
- Clean and seal if structurally sound
- Match neighborhood standards
- Consider before listing

### Before and After Impact
